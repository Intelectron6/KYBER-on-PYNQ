This folder contains the IPython Notebook in which CRYSTALS-Kyber is implemented. It also contains the .bit and .hwh files that are necessary for creating Overlay on PYNQ-Z2.
Just upload all the 3 files on PYNQ-Z2 and the code will be ready to run. 
The .bit and .hwh files can be reproduced by creating the Vivado block design with the IP generated from the Vivado HLS code (both present in this repository).
